# CI/CD Pipeline - Free Tier Configuration

This document explains the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration optimized for the free tier.

## What's Included (Free Tier)

### Main CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Quality Checks**: ESLint, TypeScript type checking, npm audit
- **Testing**: Full test suite with local coverage reporting (95 tests)
- **Build & Validation**: Extension building, manifest validation, bundle size analysis
- **Performance**: Bundle size limits (500KB) with automated checks

### Security Workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- **Weekly Security Audits**: npm audit for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Checks**: npm outdated for package updates
- **License Compliance**: Basic license checking

## What Was Removed (Paid Features)

### Removed from CI Pipeline
- ❌ **Codecov Integration**: External coverage reporting service
- ❌ **Extensive Artifact Storage**: Long-term build artifact retention
- ❌ **Advanced Deployment**: Automated release tagging and deployment
- ❌ **PR Comments**: Automated test result comments on pull requests
- ❌ **Multiple Branch Triggers**: Reduced to main branch only

### Removed from Security Workflow
- ❌ **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub Advanced Security feature (paid)
- ❌ **Daily Scans**: Reduced to weekly to save compute minutes
- ❌ **Advanced Vulnerability Processing**: Complex JSON parsing and reporting
- ❌ **Artifact Uploads**: Security audit result storage

## Free Tier Limits

### GitHub Actions Free Tier Includes:
- **2,000 minutes/month** for private repositories
- **Unlimited minutes** for public repositories
- **500MB storage** for artifacts and logs
- **20 concurrent jobs**

### Our Usage:
- **~3-5 minutes per CI run** (quality + test + build)
- **~2 minutes per security check** (weekly)
- **Estimated monthly usage**: ~150-200 minutes (well within limits)

## Benefits of Free Tier Setup

✅ **Cost-effective**: No additional charges for CI/CD
✅ **Essential quality gates**: All critical checks maintained
✅ **Fast feedback**: Parallel jobs for quick results
✅ **Reliable**: Uses only stable, free GitHub Actions features
✅ **Maintainable**: Simple configuration, easy to understand

## Local Development

For comprehensive testing and coverage analysis, developers can run:

```bash
# Full validation suite (same as CI)
npm run validate

# Individual commands
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run type-check    # TypeScript
npm run test:ci       # Tests with coverage
npm run build         # Extension build
```

## Upgrading to Paid Features

If the project grows and requires advanced features, consider:

1. **GitHub Pro/Team**: For private repositories with more minutes
2. **GitHub Advanced Security**: For CodeQL analysis
3. **External Services**: Codecov, SonarCloud for advanced code analysis
4. **Self-hosted Runners**: For unlimited compute time

## Monitoring

- Check the [Actions tab](https://github.com/zayyehtut/prompt-template-builder/actions) for workflow status
- Monitor usage in repository Settings → Billing
- CI badges in README show current status

This configuration provides robust CI/CD capabilities while staying within GitHub's free tier limits.
